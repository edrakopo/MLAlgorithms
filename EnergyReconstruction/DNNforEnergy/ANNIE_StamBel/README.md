DNN for Energy:
All DNN algorithms that we used.

First we performed /DNNforEnergy_old (hits). Then, /DNNforEnergy (mixed hits and digits) and finally /DNNforEnergy_weights (hits re-weighted).


PhaseIITreeMaker:
Here are the changes we performed on PhaseIITreeMaker Tool --> /PhaseIITreeMaker.

LoadWCSim:
There is also a change on that Tool. It doesn't really affect the analysis but it is better to be added. -->/LoadWCSim.
